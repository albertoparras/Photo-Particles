Photo Particles
---------------

This is photo particles. I wondered what would happen if I broke an image down into particles, and had three centres: red, green and blue. Each particle would be attracted to or repelled by the centres depending on how much of each component colour they contain.

All three items [three, modernizr & rAF] are included to make things simpler, but obviously if you're interested
you should take a proper look at those project. You should anyway because
they're awesome.
